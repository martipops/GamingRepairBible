# Cleaning
The Xbox One controller typically comes in with significant use. This will give you advice and tips to clean the controller to standard for refurbishment. If during cleaning, you discover a damaged part to be replaced, refer to the teardown guide to see how to remove that piece and replace it. Some parts will show more signs of damage or can be damaged during handling when it is fully cleaned, so ensure your clean parts are also free of significant damage.

## Surface Level Cleaning

### Step 1: Preparing the controller for cleaning
Before we begin cleaning any controller, we want to give it a quick look over and look for any signs of damage. This damage may have been missed by repair/testing or when it was moved from repair to when it gets in your hands now. Places to check are going to be the face for scratches, as well as the handles/bottom of the handles from where it sits on a table or potentially has been put down to hard and damaged.

### Step 2: Take off handle plastic
See teardown Chapter 1 Step 1 for information on removing the handle plastic. We removed this to have easier access to the space in between the rear shell and the handle plastic. Often lots of dirt from hands or in the air get pushed inside and can be difficult to properly clean without taking these off. Once removed, take your brush and work it along the outside area of where the pieces meet and remove dirt or debris with a combination of that, use of a microfiber with cleaner, q tip, or magic eraser for hard to remove dirt. Also ensure that you brush off the inside of the plastic handle to ensure more dirt does not enter the controller. Be mindful not to break the plastic clips when doing so.

Be careful when using the magic eraser on plastics. It is an abrasive material, like sandpaper, that works by removing tiny layers of material to clean. If you rub with too much force, you may cause damage to the plastic. Be extra careful if you use it on a glossy material as it will be more likely to cause damage.

### Step 3: Clean the buttons and joystick
Use a light amount of cleaner (do not use excessive amounts where the cleaner will drip into the controller excessively) and apply it to a stiff brush and brush around all of the buttons taking extra care to get brussels down around the outside area of the button and clean out as much debris or dirt as possible. Do the same for the joystick as well as making sure to brush the grooves of the joystick cap, any dirt inside the top, and get around the bottom gap as well as directly under the cap. Come back through with a q tip on the joystick and wipe off any excess moisture around any gaps you can. Work your way to the triggers and follow similar steps. Ensure the engraved lettering is also clean and free of any dirt. Also ensure to run a q tip around the edges of the button to collect and potential dirt.

If after cleaning any of these pieces, there are tiny lines/scratches all around the button/joystick, those are likely friction lines in the plastic. These are caused from the plastic touching other plastic as it moves, grinding it away, cleaning will not fix this and if it is excessive, will require the piece to be replaced. This is often the case with joysticks around the middle where it comes into contact with the gate border around the bottom of the joystick (Fig XO1)

### Step 4: Cleaning and checking ports, battery terminals

This is a very important step, as this is the most common area that is overlooked by repair when it comes to controllers. Look over the headphone jack to ensure it is not damaged or has something lodged in it, such as the end of a headphone jack, or not being properly seated in the plastic (See Fig XO3). Follow by also looking over bottom data port, battery terminals, as well as the charging port. The ports and terminals, while functional sometimes, can be physically damaged or clogged with dirt that will cause issues and fail quality check. Use a small pointed q tip soaked in alcohol in combination of tweezers if needed to dislodged larger balls of dirt as well as removing any dust you can. For small amounts of rust, or the blue like substance (which is usually corrosion) pictured on the battery terminals for a Gameboy Advanced in fig XO2, you can use alcohol or white vinegar to remove it. If it does not come off easily, it will need to be replaced and sent back to repair for rust or corrosion. Finish off cleaning ports with a brush and blow out with air if necessary.

### Step 5: Detailing and finishing
Continue to use cleaner and microfiber cloth on the remainder of the controller and attempt to
remove any dirt or debris. When completed, make sure to dry off the controller as best as
possible with a clean microfiber cloth and/or air.
## Deep Cleaning

### Step 1: Follow Surface Cleaning Guide until you are at Step 5.
Once you are finished with the surface level, itâ€™s time to clean inside the controller to the next level.

### Step 2: Getting inside and cleaning hard to access areas
Follow the teardown guide to the end to remove all components from the controller. The areas we will focus will be areas that are normally difficult to access from the outside, such as around the buttons/joysticks, the button silicon itself, as well as the outside edges of the shell where the outer shell meets the midshell. These are areas that over time will result in dirt being pushed into the inside of the shell which can causes additional odor or even cause functionality issues, such as a button not consistently pressing. This requires we fully disassemble the controller and clean it to ensure it functions as intended. Clean the areas of plastic around the edge of the outside as well as areas around the buttons and joystick gate. Also be sure to wipe the buttons themselves off and remove dirt/debris.

### Step 3: Cleaning the button contacts and motherboard
Fig XO4/5
While we are in this section of the controller, we will always give the front motherboard a general wipe down for longevity, or to fix certain issues. There are black conductive contact pads on the board as well as small silver buttons for the dpad (Fig XO4, XO5 for the back board contact), the silicone is pushed down by the buttons, touches the two paths, linking them, and signals the button is pressed to the controller. For the d pad, the plastic pressed on the button directly, pushing on conductive pads underneath, activating the button. We will take a q tip with alcohol on it and clean those areas until they are free of dust, dirt, or other debris. Do not use excessive liquid around the d pad as it will be difficult to dry underneath. You want to make sure you get the main buttons, as well as the options, xbox, share button, and there is also one more button contact for the B button on the rear board. While we are in here, we will also give the USB port a quick brushing, as well as the rest of the board, be mindful of small components.

### Step 4: Joystick cap, buttons, and reassembly
At this point, any damaged piece should be replaced and this includes the joystick caps. If there is damage, excessive wear, or excessive dirt, you might replace the joystick cap or buttons. They only go on one way, and it does not matter which joystick cap goes on which side, simply slide the cap over top and press down until it is in place and no longer moves down. Remember to reinstall the silicone for the buttons over top of the buttons when they are in place. Also be sure to replace certain parts such as the headphone jack and the sync button. Reassemble to controller using the teardown guide for any advice. Complete step 4 from the surface level cleaning and you have finished your deep cleaning!
